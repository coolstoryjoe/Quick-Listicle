# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

## Required Icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (small toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (context menu icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store and installation)

## Icon Design Suggestions:
- Simple, clean design
- Could use a bookmark or save icon
- Primary color: #2563eb (blue)
- Background: transparent or white

## How to create icons:
1. Use tools like Figma, Canva, or Adobe Illustrator
2. Create a simple vector icon (like a bookmark with a plus sign)
3. Export as PNG with transparent background
4. Ensure crisp edges at all sizes

## Temporary workaround for testing:
Until real icons are created, you can either:
1. Download free bookmark/save icons from the web
2. Use placeholder icons from Chrome extension examples
3. Comment out the "icons" field in manifest.json for testing
